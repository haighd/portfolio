I'm an analytics leader who believes the best data work happens when strategic thinking meets technical execution.

With experience spanning data science, machine learning, and analytics leadership, I bring a unique perspective that combines hands-on technical capability with the ability to translate complex insights into business impact.

Currently, I lead analytics initiatives at Merck, where I develop ML/AI solutions for business process optimization and partner with cross-functional teams to drive data-informed decision making.

Outside of work, I build side projects that let me explore new technologies and stay sharp on the technical side. From algorithmic trading systems to full-stack web applications, these projects keep me connected to the craft of building software.
