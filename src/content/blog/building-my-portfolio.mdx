## Why Build a Portfolio Site?

As an analytics leader transitioning between roles, I wanted a space that showcases both my leadership experience and technical depth. LinkedIn is great for professional networking, but a portfolio site allows for deeper storytelling and technical demonstrations.

## Tech Stack Decisions

### Next.js 14+ with App Router

I chose Next.js for its excellent developer experience and built-in optimizations. The App Router provides a clean way to structure pages with React Server Components by default, reducing client-side JavaScript.

### Velite for Content Management

Rather than a headless CMS, I opted for [Velite](https://velite.js.org/) - a content layer that transforms MDX files into type-safe data. This keeps content in the repository, version-controlled alongside the code.

### Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind's utility-first approach speeds up development significantly. Version 4 brings CSS-native features and improved performance.

## Key Features

- **Dark mode** - System preference detection with manual toggle
- **MDX content** - Write in Markdown with React components
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript coverage from content to components
- **Performance** - Static generation where possible, streaming where needed

## What's Next

I plan to continue adding content here - technical deep-dives on projects, thoughts on analytics leadership, and lessons learned building ML systems at scale.

Stay tuned for more posts.
