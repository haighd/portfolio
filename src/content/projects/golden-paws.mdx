challenge: "A professional pet photography studio needed a complete business platform to replace manual processes for booking, photo delivery, and customer management - while providing a premium experience that matched the quality of their photography."
approach: "Built a full-stack application with customer-first design: secure gallery sharing with automatic account linking, event-based photo organization with bulk operations, and integrated booking with Stripe payments. Focused on reliability with 84+ tests and type-safe development."
impact: "Reduced photo delivery time from days to hours with instant gallery notifications. Eliminated manual account management through automatic customer linking. 3-5x faster bulk uploads with parallel processing. 100% test pass rate ensures production reliability."
learnings: "Customer experience details matter enormously - automatic account linking removed friction that would have caused support requests. Investing in bulk operations (upload, download, watermarking) paid off immediately for the photographer's workflow. Building authentication right the first time avoided security technical debt."
