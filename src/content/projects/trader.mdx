challenge: "Building an autonomous trading system that could identify high-probability intraday setups, execute trades with strict risk controls, and operate without manual intervention while adapting to changing market conditions."
approach: "Developed an intraday gap momentum strategy targeting low-float stocks with high pre-market relative volume. Built on event-driven Python architecture with multi-layered exits (ATR stops, trailing stops, profit targets, time-based) and comprehensive pre-trade validation. Implemented three-system alignment (production, rehearsal, backtesting) to catch integration bugs before deployment."
impact: "Complete autonomous trading system with 20 epics delivered. Multi-layered risk management includes 2% position sizing, broker-level stop-losses, and circuit breakers. Three-AI code review process (Claude, Gemini, Codex) ensures code quality. React 19 dashboard provides real-time monitoring and emergency controls."
learnings: "Three-system alignment (production, rehearsal, backtesting) is essential - divergence leads to 'works in backtest, fails in production' bugs. Event-driven architecture with typed domain events enables clean component communication. Trading rehearsals that intercept orders catch integration issues that unit tests miss."

## Overview

An autonomous trading system implementing an intraday gap momentum strategy targeting low-float stocks with high pre-market relative volume. Built on Python 3.13 with event-driven architecture and strict risk controls.

## Key Features

- **Gap Momentum Strategy**: Intraday momentum targeting stocks with 3%+ gaps and 2x+ relative volume
- **Multi-Layered Exits**: ATR stops, trailing stops, profit targets, time-based exits, and EOD flatten
- **Three-System Alignment**: Production, rehearsal, and backtesting systems share code paths
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Custom asyncio event bus for reactive component communication
- **Production Dashboard**: React 19 frontend with real-time monitoring and emergency controls

## Technical Highlights

Built with a focus on reliability and operational excellence:

- Three-AI code review (Claude, Gemini, Codex) ensures quality before merge
- Trading rehearsals catch integration bugs before production deployment
- PostgreSQL persistence with comprehensive audit logging
- Docker containerization for Railway deployment
- 20 planned epics complete with 100+ stories delivered

## Architecture

The system follows a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Market Data Layer**: WebSocket streaming and historical data via Alpaca API
2. **Screening Layer**: Pre-market gap/RVOL scanning for trade candidates
3. **Strategy Layer**: Entry validation and multi-exit management
4. **Execution Layer**: Order engine with broker-level stop-losses
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time dashboard, health checks, and alerting
