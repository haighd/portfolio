## Overview

An autonomous trading system that uses statistical forecasting to identify predictable assets, then executes a direction-reversal strategy with strict risk controls.

## Key Features

- **Predictability-First Selection**: ETS forecasting models identify assets with ~55% directional accuracy
- **Inflection Point Trading**: Direction-reversal strategy captures trend changes
- **Multi-Layered Risk Management**: 2% trailing stops, daily loss circuit breakers, position limits
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Custom asyncio event bus for real-time processing
- **Production Dashboard**: React 19 frontend with real-time updates via FastAPI

## Technical Highlights

Built with a focus on reliability and observability:

- Broker-agnostic design with Alpaca integration for paper/live trading
- PostgreSQL persistence with comprehensive audit logging
- Docker containerization for Railway deployment
- Event-driven async architecture using custom asyncio patterns
- 19 of 20 planned epics complete

## Architecture

The system follows a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Data Layer**: Fetches market data and maintains historical records
2. **Analysis Layer**: Runs ETS models to score asset predictability
3. **Strategy Layer**: Implements IPT (Inflection Point Trading) logic
4. **Execution Layer**: Manages orders with risk controls
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time dashboard and alerting
